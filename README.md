# Monkeys and Bananas
A running single page application to create a game similar to snakes and ladders.

## Purpose:

This was an application to showcase my skills that I have developed over the past three weeks using HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript and JQuery.

It has been styled to be responsive with different devices both desktop and mobile.

## Functionality:

This is a single page application which consists of an instruction page, created using html and JavaScript and styled using BootStrap. It also has a board game and player icons to be avle to move around the board.

## Implementation:

The game has been implemented using:
	* HTML5
	* CSS
	* Bootstrap version 4
	* JavaScript
	* JQuery
	* Sublime text
	* Google Chrome

### Building

##Issues
Making the page responsive was a challenge as the elements did not want to align in different ways depending on the size of the page.
